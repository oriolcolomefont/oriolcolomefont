## Welcome to my GitHub.com profile! ðŸ‘‹
My name is Oriol ColomÃ©, and I am a musician and a music scientist. 

A bit about myself: Iâ€™ve spent over a decade making a living from and for this wiggly air and cognitive phenomenon we call music. While my core education is music-based, Iâ€™ve been shifting to the music tech space in the past few years, where I am developing my career. I enjoy working with all kinds of folksâ€”musicians, industry pros, academics, product people, you name it.

I have proven experience in almost all of the stages of the music production pipeline: leading and developing teams on the creative, product, and business sides, aiming to build strong relationships with stakeholders. This helps me make informed decisions to support business growth.

I like to think of myself as a jack of all trades. Although I have a more substantial musical background, I also have relevant experience in the product and tech side of the music business, which allows me to connect artistic and business needs: all things music.
