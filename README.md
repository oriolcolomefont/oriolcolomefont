Welcome to my GitHub.com profile! üëã

My name is Oriol Colom√©. I am a musician and a music scientist. I've spent over a decade making a living from, and for this wiggly air and cognitive phenomenon we call music. In the past few years, I've been shifting course towards the music tech space, though I'm still drawn to the endless possibilities that music's multimodality offers. I enjoy working with all kinds of folks‚Äîmusicians, industry pros, academics, product people, you name it.

With over a decade of experience as a professional musician, I've become a music scientist passionate about unlocking music's deeper patterns and structures through technology. My unique perspective combines hands-on musical expertise with cutting-edge computational approaches, allowing me to develop innovative solutions that serve artists and listeners.
