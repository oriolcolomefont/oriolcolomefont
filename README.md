## Welcome to my GitHub.com profile! ðŸ‘‹
My name is Oriol ColomÃ©, and I am a musician and a music scientist. 

A bit about myself: Iâ€™ve spent over a decade making a living from, and for this wiggly air and cognitive phenomenon we call music. While my core education is music-based, Iâ€™ve been shifting to the music tech space in the past few years, where I am developing my career. I enjoy working with all kinds of folksâ€”musicians, industry pros, academics, product people, you name it.

I have proven experience in almost all of the stages of the music production pipeline. I lead and develop teams on the creative, product, and business sides, aiming to build strong relationships with stakeholders. This helps me make informed decisions to support business growth.

My primary interest lies in high-level semantic abstractions closely aligned with cognitive processes related to the language of music and its theory and cultural constructs rather than the low-level intricacies of digital signal processing and audio features without a higher level of flexible contextual allegiance.

The key question that drives my curiosity is: _How can we flexibly and dynamically connect the high-resolution yet low-level representation of an electric signal through symbolic representations, systematic musicology, natural language, discrete representations, semantics, and cultural contextsâ€”all within the framework of Western musical traditions? _

I like to think of myself as a jack of all trades. Although I have a more substantial musical background, I also have relevant experience in the product and tech side of the music business, which allows me to connect artistic and business needs: all things music.
