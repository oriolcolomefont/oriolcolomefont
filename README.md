## Welcome to my GitHub.com profile! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Oriol ColomÃ© i Font, and I am a **Music Tech Generalist** with over a decade of experience across the music industry and its wiggly-air-multimodal-cognitive-phenomenon we call MUSIC.

Currently, I'm leading innovation as **Growth Lead & Product Owner** at [My Sheet Music Transcriptions](https://mysheetmusictranscriptions.com/), where I drive R&D and product development roadmaps, leveraging open-source technology and the right talent to position the company at the forefront of industry advancements.

### What I do

I bridge the gap between artistic vision and technical implementation. My expertise spans:

- **Product Development & Strategy**: Leading cross-functional teams and driving business growth through innovative music-tech solutions
- **Music Information Retrieval (MIR)**: Deep learning, audio signal processing, and computational music analysis
- **Technical Leadership**: Python, PyTorch, Google Cloud Platform, and full-stack development collaboration
- **Music Industry Expertise**: From performance and composition to music publishing and artist relations

### My Journey

I've worked with full-stack developers and musicologists alike, built cross-functional teams, and driven business growth by bridging creative, technical, and strategic domains. My experience includes:

- **My Sheet Music Transcriptions** (2022-Present): Growth Lead & Product Owner, Key Account Manager & Tech Lead
- **Epidemic Sound** (2023): Master's Thesis Student in Music Information Research, researching deep music embeddings
- **Music Technology Group (MTG-UPF)**: Member of the Scientific Committee for the UPF-BMAT Chair in AI and Music
- **Freelance Musician** (2014-Present): Performing, composing, arranging, and teaching across Europe

### Education & Research

- **MSc in Sound and Music Computing** - Universitat Pompeu Fabra (2021-2023)
- **MA in Music Theory and Composition** - ESMUC (2019-2020)
- **BA in Music Performance** - ESEM Taller de MÃºsics (2014-2018)

My research focuses on **high-level semantic abstractions** closely aligned with cognitive processes related to music language and theory. The key question that drives my curiosity is: **_how can we flexibly and dynamically connect the high-resolution yet low-level representation of an electric signal through symbolic representations, systematic musicology, natural language, discrete representations, semantics, and cultural contextsâ€”all within the framework of Western musical traditions?_**
