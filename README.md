> Catalan musician turned music scientist, bridging the gap between art and technology.

I’ve spent over a decade making a living from, and for this wiggly air and cognitive phenomenon we call music. In the past few years, I’ve been shifting course towards the music tech space, though I’m still drawn to the endless possibilities that music’s multimodality offers. I enjoy working with all kinds of folks—musicians, industry pros, academics, product people, you name it.

I’m obsessed with high-level abstract retrieval in music data and how they can bring value to anything—artists, listeners, products, or whatever else music touches.
