## Hi there 👋
I am a Catalan musician turned music scientist. I’ve spent over a decade making a living from and for this wiggly air and cognitive phenomenon we call **music**__. In the past few years, I’ve been shifting course towards the music tech space, though I’m still drawn to the endless possibilities that music’s multimodality offers. I enjoy working with all kinds of folks—musicians, industry pros, academics, product people, you name it.

I’m obsessed with high-level retrieval in music and how they can bring value to just about anything—artists, listeners, products, or whatever else music touches.

Always eager to hit the following note, I'm ready for new challenges.
